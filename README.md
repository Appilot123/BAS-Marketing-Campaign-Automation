<h1 align="center">BAS Marketing Campaign Automation</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is designed to showcase a robust, standalone bot built with **Browser Automation Studio** (**BAS**) for automating comprehensive marketing campaigns. The goal is to simplify repetitive marketing workflows like lead scraping, email generation, and SEO tasks, all while supporting multithreading and proxy rotation. It’s especially useful for solo marketers or small agencies looking to scale outreach without heavy coding expertise.

We’re focusing on making it accessible—even if you’re new to automation. The bot’s designed around BAS’s simple scripting flow, so you can tweak campaigns for SEO, email blasts, social media posting, and lead generation without fuss.

## Core Features:
- **Simple and Accessible:** Built with BAS’s drag-and-drop scripting UI for easy customization and learning.
- **Multi-Threaded Workflows:** Supports parallel processing for scraping and posting across multiple accounts.
- **Integrated Proxy and Captcha Handling:** Seamless proxy rotation and CAPTCHA solving for stealth and scale.
